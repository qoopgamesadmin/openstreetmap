## What it is
`mexicocity.bytes` is a derived database made from an OpenStreetMap extract. It is used by the game Qoop World
(qoop games) to draw the real streets, building footprints, coast, parks and sights of this area.

## How it was made (the method of the alterations)
- Downloaded: 29 September 2026, from the Overpass API (https://overpass-api.de), with the queries in `q-*.txt`.
- Area: south 19.4236, west -99.1427, north 19.4416, east -99.1237 (the heart of MexicoCity).
- Processed with `build_city.py` (in this folder):
  `python3 build_city.py <folder with the downloaded .json> mexicocity.bytes 19.4236 -99.1427 19.4416 -99.1237`
  The script keeps geometry and a few tags (building type, levels, height; road type, bridge; names of places of
  worship, historic buildings and sights — Turkish, else English, else the local name in Latin letters),
  simplifies lines, converts to metres from the middle of the area, and draws the land and sea as a 4 m raster
  from the coastline.

## File format
See the header of `build_city.py`: magic `QRC1`, the area, the land raster as runs per row, then the features
(kind, sub-type, levels, points in decimetres, name).

## Ground heights
The file ends with the ground's heights (`HGT1` section), from the Terrain Tiles on the AWS Registry of Open Data
(Tilezen/Mapzen, terrarium PNG, zoom 14), fetched with `fetch_heights.py` for the same box. Attribution for the
terrain data: https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/attribution.md
